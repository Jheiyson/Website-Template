Website-Template
================


A website template is a pre-designed webpage, or set of webpages, 
that anyone can modify with their own content and images to setup a website. 
Usually built using HTML and CSS code, website templates allow anyone to setup
a website without having to hire a professional web developer or designer, although,
many developers do use website templates to create sites for their clients. 
his allows anyone to setup a reasonably priced personal or business website 
while creating an Internet presence that will be listed in search engines when users
search for your product or service. In the case of Allwebco website templates, 
each template is a complete website that you can use to "plug-in" your own text and 
images with little, or no, editing of the layout or design.
